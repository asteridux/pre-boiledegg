# Pre-boiledegg

![](./logo.png)

### A minimalist Preact starter kit/boilerplate

Build status: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/asteridux/pre-boiledegg.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/AntJanus/asteridux:Why)

## Why?
Boilerplates are usually heavy to address everyone's concerns and start users out with the best app they can for scaling. Starter kits / Seeds usually utilize lots of clever tactics that the authors encountered whilst in production and can be confusing.

The `boiledegg` starter kits are meant to provide a developer (you!) with an easy-to-understand minimalist setup that can be completely overwritten without breaking anything. It's really easy to dive in and make the repo your own.

**Note:** Pre-boiledegg is not meant to be constantly merged in/updated with your current project. You hit the ground running with it and look back only to start new apps.

## Requirements

Pre-boiledegg is built with Node v8.x.x support in mind but most likely works >4.x.x

## Installation and setup

1. git clone this repo
2. remove `.git`
3. `git init` to initialize your own repository
4. update README, package.json, etc. with your own application names
5. `npm install`

And you're done!

## Will this ever be like create-react-app?

Nope! But I AM working on a similar type of deal in my [Kompilator repository](https://https://github.com/asteridux/kompilator).
